# Startup Profit Forecasting Program

Welcome to the Startup Profit Forecasting program, written in Python and implemented using a Jupyter notebook!

This program uses machine learning tools, specifically multiple linear regression, to forecast the profits of startup companies. The program utilizes a profit database that is included in the program files to train and evaluate the multiple linear regression model. The program then takes in various input variables that may affect the profitability of a startup and uses the trained model to predict the expected profits.
